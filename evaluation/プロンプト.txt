You are an excellent programmer.
Please determine if the following literal normalization is useful.
"Useful" refers to a change pattern that meets all the following conditions:
For any code fragment that matches the "before" section of the change pattern, the "after" code fragment can be universally generated.
The transformation can be applied to all matched code fragments without breaking their behavior.
Normalized nodes present in the "after" section of the change pattern must also exist in the "before" section.
Also, [$V1],[$V2], etc. indicate that the variables are normalized, which does not affect their usefulness.
And $L1, $L2, etc. indicate that the literal is normalized, and you should only determine if this is the correct normalization.
Output only "True" or "False".

Example1
Input:
History
//before
assertEquals([$V4],"Hoge");
//after
assertThat([$V4], is("Hoge"));

Normalized Pattern
//before
assertEquals([$V4],$L5);
//after
assertThat([$V4], is($L5));

Output:
True

Example2
Input:
History
//before
assertEquals([$V4],"");
//after
assertThat([$V4]).isEmpty();

Normalized Pattern
//before
assertEquals([$V4],$L5);
//after\n
assertThat([$V4]).isEmpty();

Output:
False
